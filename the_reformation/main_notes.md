# Chapter Two

- Martin Luther is not the sole source of The Reformation. The time in which he lived was full of moments of religious deviation. "The world into which Martin Luther was born in 1483 was full of new religious things"
- "Objects and centers of devotion of this kind [ie, cults of worship not aligning with Catholic orthodoxy] were rarely planned and constructed by those who claimed to be in the charge of the Church. Typically they arose from popular 'devotion,' often uncontrolled. Everywhere the church authorities were engaged in delicate balancing acts. Should they encourage or discourage such spontaneity?"
- This environment resulted in a world in which "'Reform' was on everyone's lips in the fifteenth century."
